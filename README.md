**Bobby’s Breakout**​ is a single-player 2D top-down open-world adventure game set at SFU where the player takes a peek into the life of Bobby Chan. They will experience Bobby’s acute stress response to being swarmed by an apocalyptic hoard of students seeking help / advice, complaints, or just to be a nuisance. Bobby will have to make his way through the maze of antagonistic students, professors, and environmental obstructions to leave campus (the winning condition) and safely return home to his family… only to do this again the next day.
